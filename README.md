**Rag-QASystem**

A document-based Question-and-Answer (Q&A) system leveraging Gemini and Streamlit. This project allows users to upload documents and query them in natural language, providing fast and accurate responses.

Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for document-based Q&A. Users can upload documents, which are processed and indexed for efficient querying. Powered by Gemini, the system retrieves relevant information and generates responses via a seamless Streamlit UI.

Features

	•	Upload multiple documents (PDFs, Word files, or text documents).
	•	Efficient document retrieval and indexing.
	•	Natural language querying for accurate Q&A.
	•	Interactive user interface using Streamlit.
	•	Scalability for larger datasets and complex queries.

Technologies Used

	•	Python: Core language for the backend.
	•	Gemini: Framework for retrieval-augmented generation.
	•	Streamlit: Framework for creating the user interface.
	•	Pandas: Data manipulation and processing.
	•	PyPDF2: PDF parsing and text extraction.
